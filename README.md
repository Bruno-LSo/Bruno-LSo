## Data Science for a Better Future  

I discovered my passion for data science and its possibilities during my 13 years as a public servant at COPASA. Now, my focus is on developing data-driven projects that can generate a positive social impact and, hopefully, transform our reality.  

With a background in **Systems Analysis and Development** and a **bachelor’s degree in Philosophy**, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving. My experience in **data analytics, machine learning, and full-stack development** is reflected in my projects. Given my deep interest in the **healthcare sector**, I direct most of my work toward solutions that can improve decision-making and accessibility in this field.  

### What I Do  

- **Data Science & Machine Learning** – Developing models for prediction, optimization, and decision-making, often applied to healthcare challenges.  
- **Data Integration & Processing** – Transforming raw data into actionable insights, with a focus on practical applications in real-world scenarios.  
- **Full-Stack Development** – Building web and mobile applications with **Node.js, React, and React Native** to support data-driven solutions.  

### Current Focus  

- Enhancing my expertise in **data science, web development, and AI** through real-world projects.  
- Applying **data-driven approaches to healthcare**, aiming to improve patient outcomes and system efficiency.  
- Building **intuitive and scalable solutions** that bridge the gap between technology and decision-making in critical areas.
